Listing azure resources using python automation script

# Azure Resource Listing Script (Mock Version)

This is a simulated version of an Azure SDK script that lists resources.
It uses mock data for environments without an Azure subscription.
Can be upgraded to use `azure-identity` and `azure-mgmt-resource` with a real Azure account.
